- 👋 Hi, I’m @derekaxelrose
- 👀 I’m interested in ...color grading, 1st AC work, lighting, screenplay writing, projection compositing, engineering, legal & 'red tape' work (whether building calculators and micro budgets connected to pie charts and macro budgets, whatever you like), and in all cases going by all means necessary until I break down in order to get where I need.. Of the strong observation that people often confuse what's uncomfortable/difficult with what's impossible; I'm not concerned with what's difficult, only what's possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... All of the aformentioned and then some (learning about using DCTL's in da Vinci, lawsuits, cartography, work around missing macro tubes, working like a de-occultist student to crack open the keys to cinematic quality that aren't forthcoming, whatever you like)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... ALL of the aformentioned, but I do have a partner in all decision with 50/50 and I have no intention now or ever to alter that dynamic no matter what we have to go through. It's been the winning formula for both evolution & refinement. If there were time outside of this for something else, or when we need to subcontract other individuals? Absolutely! =]
- 📫 How to reach me ... Meh, my email
